# Scientific Report: Determining Refractive Index using Snell's Law

## üìú Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed scientific report documenting an experiment to determine the refractive index of a glass block by applying Snell's Law. This work was undertaken as part of my Foundation year's physics laboratory.

The project involved precise experimental setup, data collection using various approaches, analysis of results, consideration of experimental uncertainties and limitations, and the formal write-up of findings in a structured scientific report.

## üìÑ Abstract

The refractive index of a material shows how much a beam of light is bent or refracted when it enters a medium. The purpose of this lab is to determine the refractive index of a glass block using a specific law (Snell‚Äôs Law). A light source (ray box) passing through a slit is directed towards the glass block positioned on a graph paper. Using 4 different methods, the angles are measured with a protractor and the light rays with a ruler. The different refractive indexes are then compared to the expected result. Important assumptions, approximations, and limitations are considered as they are key factors for this experiment. The results demonstrate that it is possible to find the refractive index with every method. Further recommendations to conduct this experiment are given to improve the accuracy of the refractive index.

## üî¨ Experiment Highlights & Methodologies

The core objective was to determine the refractive index of a glass block. This was achieved by:

* Utilising a ray box, glass block, protractor, and ruler for precise measurements.
* Applying Snell's Law (`n1 sin(Œ∏1) = n2 sin(Œ∏2)`).
* Employing **four distinct analytical methods** to calculate the refractive index, including graphical analysis and direct trigonometric approaches (further detailed in the full report).
    * One method involved specific consideration of outliers: [See details of Method 2](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8lclowzfx0)
    * Another method utilised direct SOHCAHTOA applications: [See details of Method 4](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yuo6izlqbp)
* Comparing experimental values to the expected refractive index of glass (approx. 1.5).
* Analysing sources of error and discussing the assumptions and limitations of the experiment.
