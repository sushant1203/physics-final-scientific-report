# Scientific Report: Determining Refractive Index using Snell's Law

## üìú Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed scientific report documenting an experiment to determine the refractive index of a glass block by applying Snell's Law. This work was undertaken as part of my Foundation year's physics laboratory.

The project involved precise experimental setup, data collection using various approaches, analysis of results, consideration of experimental uncertainties and limitations, and the formal write-up of findings in a structured scientific report.

## üìÑ Abstract

The refractive index of a material shows how much a beam of light is bent or refracted when it enters a medium. The purpose of this lab is to determine the refractive index of a glass block using a specific law (Snell‚Äôs Law). A light source (ray box) passing through a slit is directed towards the glass block positioned on a graph paper. Using 4 different methods, the angles are measured with a protractor and the light rays with a ruler. The different refractive indexes are then compared to the expected result. Important assumptions, approximations, and limitations are considered as they are key factors for this experiment. The results demonstrate that it is possible to find the refractive index with every method. Further recommendations to conduct this experiment are given to improve the accuracy of the refractive index.

## üìñ Report Structure & Key Content

The full report follows a standard scientific structure:

* **Introduction:** Outlines the aim of the experiment and provides the theoretical background of Snell's Law and the concept of refractive index. *(The refractive index of a material is the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in that material.)*
* **Experimental Method:** Details the apparatus used (light source, glass block, protractor, ruler, etc.), the setup, and the procedures followed for measuring angles of incidence and refraction. The experiment explored **four distinct methods to determine the refractive index (n‚ÇÇ)**:
    * **Method 1:**: Standard graphical method plotting sin(Œ∏i) vs sin(Œ∏r)
    * **Method 2 (with outlier consideration):**Analysis of the dataset with specific outlier removal criteria applied before calculating 'n'.
[See details of Method 2](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8lclowzfx0)]
    * **Method 3:** Direct calculation from individual angle pairs.
    * **Method 4 (SOHCAHTOA application):** Utilising direct trigonometric relationships (SOHCAHTOA) from ray tracing diagrams.
[See details of Method 4](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yuo6izlqbp)]
* **Results:** Presents the collected data, calculations for the refractive index from each of the four methods, and includes tables and potentially graphs (e.g., `sin Œ∏i` vs. `sin Œ∏r`). This section shows the comparative results from each approach.
* **Discussion:** Analyses the obtained results, compares values from the different methods (including the specific considerations for method 2 and the trigonometric approach of method 4), discusses sources of error and uncertainty, evaluates assumptions and limitations, and compares findings to expected values for glass (approximately 1.5).
* **Conclusion:** Summarises the findings about the initial aims, reflects on the success and nuances of the different methods employed, and provides recommendations for improving experimental accuracy.
